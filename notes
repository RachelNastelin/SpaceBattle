========= TODO ==========
1. Fix problem with server exiting immediately once two clients are connected
2. Get things to move when playing
3. Work on cannonball shooting
4. Get things to be drawn correctly
5. ** Project report **
6. Whatever evaluation/testing we're doing for the report
7. Decide what parts of the project to cut and cut them (?)

========= Current Status ==========
UI: Opaque black window pops up, and once two clients are connected, one ship is drawn on both windows. 
       Spaceship does not move in response to user input. No other drawings. When dragged, two windows pick up 
       the background from each other. 
Driver: Written, compiles, working on collision (?)
Server: Server can connect to the clients and send information back and forth. Calls driver functions 
        when appropriate. EXITS AFTER BOTH CLIENTS CONNECT DUE TO SOME PROBLEM WITH CONTNIUE_FLAG
Client: Written, compiles, calls board functions when appropriate. Can't quit, but maybe that's because server breaks.

===== Questions =====
1. Why is continue_flag setting itself to false after both clients join?
2. Why is only one ship being drawn?


===== Change before turning in =====
Server: Get rid of print statement when a new client connects because the
        clientIDs are wrong and can't be fixed
