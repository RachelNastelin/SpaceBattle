Will: Driver, computations for server
Rachel: Server, communicating with clients
Caelin: Client, user input, UI stuff(?)


As of right now, the server connects to the clients but doesn't send information
back and forth. 

According to our project proposal, the server redraws the board, not the
clients. How are we doing that? How do we pass a board between the server and
clients?
