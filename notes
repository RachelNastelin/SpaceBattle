========= TODO ==========
1. GUI stuff: (Caelin)
        - Call update_display more often so you don't pick up the background when moving the window
        - Linker error with stars in Client.cu
        - Make sure that when you try to draw something, it actually shows up
2. Server and Driver: (Will)
        - Fix mallocing and freeing calls in driver.cu 
        - Make sure server calls driver functions correctly
3. Make it possible for users to quit (Rachel)

========= Current Status ==========
UI: Opaque white window pops up, but when dragged, two windows pick up the background from each other. 
Driver: Written, compiles, working on collision (?)
Server: Server can connect to the clients and send information back and forth. Calls driver functions 
        when appropriate. 
Client: Written, compiles, calls board functions when appropriate. MISSING USER INPUT, DO THIS NEXT

-quitting/continue_flag may be a problem later? (Neither is fully implemented... we should only need one)


===== Change before turning in =====
Server: Get rid of print statement when a new client connects because the
        clientIDs are wrong and can't be fixed
